# Abstract
The world has been grudgingly augmented with the meteoric rise of cryptocurrencies, awareness of which has driven accelerated advancement efforts in decentralization of services. Although still incunabulum, the prospect synthesis of decentralization with Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will bear modern shared economic models that repositions how value is
dispersed using autonomous community services. These services will facilitate commerce between entities, individuals, and devices that trade on a trusted decentralized community chain. 

WeatherBlock proffers to develop a weather ecosystem combining advanced weather station IoT devices with a decentralized, blockchain based service protocol using unified community
delegated consensus methods leveraging WXB as initial utility and future protocol token for economic trade. 

The new market will be Delivering Shared Economic Market using interconnected IoT weather devices to generate block production rewards and consumption incentives using publicly verifiable weather data storage and retrieval services. It will comprise of various novel cryptographic schemes that prove integrity of weather data.
